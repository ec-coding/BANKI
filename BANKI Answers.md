## Behavioral

Most of the behavioral questions should be answered in the CAR format. At least three sentences for each question (one for cause, one for action and one for result). When answering begin with "At my last opportunity..." or "At my last company". Don't sell yourself out and say "bootcamp" or "school".

### CAR

- **Cause**
  - Why did you need to take action?
- **Action**
  - Steps you took so solve problem
  - Be positive
  - Don't be humble
- **Result**
  - How are you better?

### Questions

- [x] B1) Give me an example of a project or initiative that you started on your own. What prompted you to get started?

  - **Cause:** Shortly after I had left my first teaching position, I wound up wanting to spend some of my free time outside of work towards helping students from underprivileged families.
  - **Action:** Thus, I began a non-for-profit tutoring service for underprivileged grade school students, using connections I had made from my job in teaching, and also from the church I was attending at the time. I offered educational assistance in areas they were struggling in, namely for Math and Language Arts.
  - **Result:** The program lasted about 4 months, and was a tremendous success. We had amazing turnouts every week, and I myself ended up learning some valuable life lessons that I still carry with me to this day.

- [x] B2) Tell me about a time you had to work on several projects at once. How did you handle this?

  - **Cause:** During my freelancing period, I was contracted to work on multiple websites at once for different clients.
  - **Action:** I handled the workload by designating certain days and time slots for different clients, so that I would not have to divert my focus back and forth between them. In essence, they were all promised specific days where I would reach out to them with updates.
  - **Result:** The result was that I was able to tend to each client’s needs in a timely and organized fashion, which allowed me to complete each project according to their specifications. 

- [x] B3) Describe a situation in which you felt you had not communicated well enough. What did you do? How did you handle it?

  - **Cause:** At the start of a major portfolio review during my days in ocean freight shipping, I discovered that critical roles were not delegated to the proper individuals at the time of the project’s conception. 
  - **Action:** After convening with my teammates and coming to a consensus, we agreed to allocate separate responsibilities to each individual to ensure a smooth trajectory for the project. 
  - **Result:** The result was that we were able to greatly reduce the amount of role overlap brought about by the initial lack of communication, and work morale ended up improving tremendously. The portfolio was thus completed successfully and in a timely fashion.

- [x] B4) Tell me about when you had to deal with conflict within your team. How was the conflict solved? How did you handle that? How would you deal with it now?

  - **Cause:**  During my previous occupation in ocean freight shipping, I once volunteered to lead a project that would audit the company’s invoices for a specific client. The client was claiming that our company owed them a sizable sum of money due to unreported reserves.
  - **Action:** Some of my team members debated the merit of working on the project due to the lack of bonus or overtime offered. Many of them were disappointed that I had chosen to accept it, as they felt I should have negotiated for compensation beforehand.
  - **Result:** I reassured them that it was not their responsibility, and that they were not expected to contribute if they did not want to. I took on the project alone initially, but my work ethic gradually inspired my team members to volunteer their assistance over time, and we ended up completing it as a joint project together.

- [x] B5) Give me an example of a time you had to take a creative and unusual approach to solve coding problem. How did this idea come to your mind? Why do you think it was unusual?

  - **Cause:** I once had an issue deploying a project on Heroku, due to constant errors stemming from my back-end code.
  - **Action:** Because my server-side code was all contained in one file, I searched for possible ways to divide it up so that I could quarantine specific sectors to narrow down the problem area. I felt it was a very unorthodox approach at the time, as I had never thought to split my code in such fashion.
  - **Result:** In the process, I came across the concept of MVC architecture and learned how its use made it possible to mitigate the exact troubleshoots I was suffering from. I ended up adopting this architecture into all my future projects going forward.

- [x] B6) Describe a situation in which you worked diligently on a project and it did not produce the desired results. Why didn't you get the desired results? What did you learn from the experience?

  - **Cause:** My first experience with coding was to try and build a personal website to kickstart my portfolio.
  - **Action:** I attempted to create a sophisticated layout with animations and scroll-based events using only a limited knowledge of HTML and CSS, and no insight on JavaScript.
  - **Result:** I did not produce the desired results because the lack of JavaScript made it impossible for the site to trigger user events and display the appropriate content. This experience taught me the importance of each of the three front-end languages, and from then onwards, I was motivated to learn how they function altogether.

- [x] B7) Give an example of an important project goal you reached and how you achieved it.

  - **Cause:** I was once tasked with training new hires at a previous workplace, which dealt with ocean freight shipping. However, due to the outdated software that said company used, it was very difficult to relate its functions to modern-day applications.
  - **Action:** I took the initiative to document the software’s capabilities using OneNote, and included many examples on how the trainees could better understand the tasks it was developed for.
  - **Result:** The new hires were successfully trained and became integrated into my team. Furthermore, the documentation I created for the company ended up becoming the de facto training manual for future hires and internal transfers.

- [x] B8) Describe a situation in which you experienced difficulty in getting others to accept your ideas? What was your approach? How did this work? Were you able to successfully persuade someone to see things your way?

  - **Cause:** At one of my previous workplaces, we were once tasked with learning new software for taking client calls. 
  - **Action:** Because the onboarding sessions were long and scarce in breaks, I suggested to management if our team could utilize the pomodoro technique, which basically entails 25 minutes of dedicated focus, followed by a 5-minute break, all with the aim of reducing burnout.  
  - **Result:** The idea was rejected at the time, because the supervisor in charge of the course was intent on following a set schedule. However, after the workshop had ended, I approached some of my superiors and explained the merits of pomodo in a polite and civil manner. We ended up having a great discussion about employee learning expectations, and they promised to look into implementing such techniques for future onboarding sessions.

- [x] B9) Tell me about a situation when you were responsible for project planning. Did everything go according to your plan? If not, then why and what kind of counteractions did you have to take?

  - **Cause:**  At a previous job I held for a factoring company, I was placed in charge of a project that was meant to minimize the company’s financial loss due to over-aged invoices. Many of our clients were notorious for submitting shoddy paperwork that would often be rejected by their brokering companies, which led to us not receiving payment.
  - **Action:** To achieve the goals of this project, I proposed a plan to penalize repeat-offending clients with delayed purchasing dates for each time they had paperwork rejected for their truckloads. 
  - **Result:** The plan was a huge success, and as it incentivized a great number of our clients to begin submitting proper paperwork, which then eliminated a large fraction of the over-aged and unpaid invoices our division had been suffering from.
  - 
- [x] B10) Tell me about a situation when you made a mistake at work. What happened exactly and how did you deal with it? What steps did you take to improve the situation?

  - **Cause:** I once mistakenly authorized the release of a fraudulent load at my previous shipping company, which cost them a sizable amount of money when the client refused to pay for the load post-release.
  - **Action:** Afterwards, I approached my superiors and claimed responsibility for the error. I explained to them how my inexperience with detecting counterfeit invoices led me to making the mistake I did, and I promised I would be much more careful in the future if they would be willing to give me another chance.
  - **Result:** My acting manager at the time reassured me that disciplinary action was unnecessary, because seeing me own my mistake and realizing the severity of it would ensure I never repeated it in the future. I took her message to heart and the extra steps I took going forward to scan for fraudulent loads prevented me from repeating the same mistake throughout my time with the company.

- [x] B11) Tell me about a time when you worked with someone who was not completing his or her share of the work. How did you handle the situation? Did you discuss your concern with your coworker? With your manager? If yes, how did your coworker respond to your concern? What was your manager's response?

  - **Cause:** During my days in ocean freight shipping, my team had recently acquired a new member who had completed his internship with the company. However, because he had been initially trained for a different department, he had great difficulty transitioning into our responsibilities, and often missed his invoicing quotas for the day.
  - **Action:** However, because his intentions to learn and excel at his responsibilities seemed genuine, I chose not to report this case to upper management, and instead opted to assist this team member directly. During downtime, or after I had clocked out for the day, I took the effort to tutor him on his new role and how he could further assist the team by improving his skill-set.
  - **Result:** As a result, this individual became highly adept with his work responsibilities and no longer fell short of the team’s expectations. The time I had committed towards helping him had definitely borne great fruit, and we ended up working closely together for the rest of my duration with the company.

- [x] B12) Describe a situation when you worked effectively under pressure. How did you feel when working under pressure? What was going on, and how did you get through it?

  - **Cause:** At my previous workplace, I often had to work under pressure at the end of each month, due to the large influx of client invoices that arrived around said time.
  - **Action:** Repeated exposure to working under these hectic conditions allowed me to develop efficient time management skills so that I could divide and conquer my tasks with sufficient breakpoints in between.
  - **Result:** Each experience built upon the previous to the point where I felt little to no anxiety while working under high pressure conditions. I feel I have become a far more tempered worker as a result.

- [x] B13) Tell me about yourself.

  - I am a highly motivated candidate with an aptitude for productivity and process streamlining. I enjoy both the client-side and server-side immensely, and am excited that this opportunity would allow me to grow in both aspects. I really enjoy the idea that I’ll be able to see the results of my work and its connection to improving research. I think having exposure to this connection will motivate me in the long term because it aligns with my need to constantly improve my process efficiency skills.

- [x] B14) Tell me about your experience at 100Devs.

  - 100Devs is a software development agency with a training program. I worked on several projects both alone and with teammates to better refine my technical skills. The main tech stack we used were React, Node, Express, and MongoDB.

- [ ] b15) What do you know about our company?

  - **Cause:** 
  - **Action:**
  - **Result:**

- [ ] B16) Why do you want to work for us?


  - **Cause:** 
  - **Action:** 
  - **Result:** 
  

- [ ] B17) Why are you interested in this opportunity?

  - **Cause:** 
  - **Action:** 
  - **Result:** 

- [ ] B18) Tell me about your dream job?  What do you really want to do with your career?

  - **Cause:** I would like to work in a position that spurs me to continuously improve upon my skill-set. I loathe the thought of becoming stagnant with my ambitions, and am always looking to gain higher ground with my learning and self-improvement. 
  - **Action:** 
  - **Result:** 

- [x] B19) Tell me a time when you failed.

  - **Cause:** During the start of my freelancing period, I was overly ambitious and advertised website builds I was not completely experienced with developing at the time. 
  - **Action:** As a result, I ended up disappointing my very first client by agreeing with all their demands and over-promising on features I was unable to deliver.
  - **Result:** The entire process taught me the value of learning when to say “No” and to always be honest about my limitations with the people I work with. As I moved forward from this experience, I have stood by the principle of under-promising and over-delivering when possible.

- [x] B20) What do you read on a regular basis?
  - Recently I've been reading various books on Data Structures & Algorithms along with books about different styles of coding architecture.
  - I'll also typically read movie screenplays, self-help books, and cooking guides. I'm a huge fan of our public library system and regularly use it.

- [ ] B21) What's some critical feedback you've gotten recently?

  - **Cause:** 
  - **Action:** 
  - **Result:** 
  

- [ ] B22) Do you have any questions?
- What is the interview process like? What is the timeline?
- What are some of the challenges for the person in this position?
- What is a typical day in this position?
- What is the onboarding process after the offer?

## Technical Questions

Most of the technical questions should have a three sentence response in the EUE format:

- **Explanation**
- **Use**
- **Example**

### HTML

- [x] What does a doctype do?
  - **Explanation:** A doctype tells the browser what version of HTML the document is written in.
  - **Use:** Must be the very first line of code in an HTML document. 
  - **Example:** Modern HTML5 documents use the tag `<!DOCTYPE html>`
  - **Source:**
- [x] How do you serve a page with content in multiple languages?
  - **Explanation:** By setting the lang attribute on various elements throughout the page. 
  - **Use:** Translates the text within the attribute’s container into a selected language.
  - **Example:** `<p> French “ <span lang=”fr”> Bonjour </span> “ </p>`
  - **Source:**
- [x] What kinds of things must you be wary of when designing or developing for multilingual sites?
  - **Explanation:**
      - Including the `lang` attribute.
      - How colors are perceived.
      - Language reading direction.
      - Date and currency formats.
      - Allowing users to change the language.
  - **Source:**
- [x] What are `data-` attributes good for?
  - **Explanation:** They store data private to the page or application.
  - **Use:** Were often used for storing extra data in the DOM, but their use is discouraged now.
  - **Example:** `data-columns=”3”` | `data-index-number=”12314”`
  - **Source:**
- [x] Consider HTML5 as an open web platform. What are the building blocks of HTML5?
  - **Explanation:**
      - Semantics - Allows you to describe precisely what your content is
      - Multimedia - Making video and audio priority items on the open web.
      - Performance and Integration - Speed optimization
      - Styling - More sophisticated themes
      - Standardization - Building a consensus across all involved web browser stakeholders.
  - **Source:**
- [x] Describe the difference between a cookie, sessionStorage and localStorage.
  - **Explanation:** Cookies are typically set by a web server and can store data that is read by both the web server and the web browser. Local storage and session storage are only readable by the browser. The difference between the two is their lifetime; localStorage lasts forever, and sessionStorage only lasts for the length of the session.
  - **Use:** All used for client-side storage of strings in key-value pairs.
  - **Source:**
- [x] Describe the difference between `<script>, <script async> and <script defer>`.
  - **Explanation:**
      - <script> HTML parsing is blocked, script is fetched and executed right away.
      - <script async> script fetched in parallel to HTML parsing and executed as soon as it is available.
      - <script defer> script fetched in parallel to HTML parsing and executed when the page has finished parsing.
  - **Use:**
      - `async` is used when the script is independent of any other scripts on the page.
      - `defer` is useful when you need to ensure the HTML is fully parsed before running.
  - **Example:**
      - `async` could be used for analytics scripts.
      - `defer` scripts must not contain `document.write`
  - **Source:**
- [x] Why is it generally a good idea to position CSS `<link>`s within `<head>` and JS `<script>`s just before `</body>`? Do you know any exceptions?
  - **Explanation:** Placing <link> in the <head> allows for quick “first meaningful paint”. When a page first loads, HTML and CSS are being parsed simultaneously. However, <script> tags block HTML parsing while they are being downloaded and run, which can slow down your page. Thus, placing scripts at the bottom will allow the HTML to be parsed and displayed to the user first.
  - **Source:**
- [x] What is progressive rendering?
  - **Explanation:** Progressive rendering is a technique used to improve the performance of a webpage so that it can render content for display ASAP.
  - **Use:** Improving perceived load time.
  - **Example:** Lazy loading of images, prioritizing visible content, and async HTML fragments.
  - **Source:**
- [x] Why you would use a `srcset` attribute in an image tag? Explain the process the browser uses when evaluating the content of this attribute.
  - **Explanation:** When you want to serve different images to users depending on their device display width.
  - **Use:** Sending lower resolution to limit data waste and increase performance or sending larger images to a higher resolution display to enhance the UX.
  - **Example:** `<img srcset =”small.jpg 500w, medium.jpg 1000w, large.jpg 2000w” src=”...” alt=””>`
  - **Source:**
- [x] Have you used different HTML templating languages before?
  - **Explanation:** Yes, EJS and HBS. They are more or less the same as each other and provide similar functionality to escape content and provide helpful filters for manipulating the data to be displayed. Most templating engines also allow you to inject your own filters in the event you require custom processing before display.
  - **Source:**

### CSS

- [x] What is CSS selector specificity and how does it work?
  - **Explanation:** How browsers decide which CSS property values are the most relevant to an element and how to apply them.
  - **Use:** Specificity is a score that is applied to a given CSS declaration, and is determined by the number of each selector type that it calls upon.
  - **Example:** A selector of `#id .class tag` would have 111 points, as id’s count for 100, classes count for 10, and tags count for 1.
  - **Source:**
- [x] What's the difference between "resetting" and "normalizing" CSS? Which would you choose, and why?
  - **Explanation:** “Normalize” alteres the default styles of various browsers to match each other. “Reset” will remove a browser’s default styles so you are starting from scratch.
  - **Use:** Using one or the other is done so that websites can remain visually consistent across different browsers. I prefer CSS normalize because of its style presets.
  - **Example:**

Normalize:

```css
/**
 * Correct the font size and margin on `h1` elements within `section` and
 * `article` contexts in Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.
 */

h1 {
  font-size: 2em;
  margin: 0.67em 0;
}
```
	
Reset:

```css
html,
body,
h1,
h2,
h3,
h4,
h5,
h6 {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}
```
   
  - **Source:**
- [x] Describe floats and how they work.
  - **Explanation:** They are a positioning property where an element that is floated will be removed from the flow of the page and affect elements around it. `.clearfix` hacks are used to fix parent elements which collapse to zero height due to containing only floated elements.
  - **Use:** Floats were used prior to flex and grid to organize pages in a more flexible way.
  - **Example:** You can float three `<div>` elements left and give them widths of 33% each to create three columns with equal width.
  - **Source:**
- [x] Describe z-index and how stacking context is formed.
  - **Explanation:** Z-index allows you to stack elements above or below one another to affect their visibility. Stacking context is formed by the parent-child relationship of nested elements, and the order of elements in the DOM.
  - **Use:** Giving a planet image with a transparent background a higher z-index so that it appears in front of a dark-colored background with a lower z-index.
  - **Example:** 
   `#planet {
      position: relative;
      z-index: 1
   }`
  - **Source:**
- [x] Describe BFC (Block Formatting Context) and how it works.
  - **Explanation:** A BFC is an HTML box that satisfies one or more of the following conditions:
      - The value of float is not ‘none’.
      - The value of position is neither static nor relative.
      - The value of display is table-cell, table-caption, inline-block, flex, or inline-flex, grid, or inline-grid.
      - The value of overflow is not visible. 
  - **Use:** Knowing how to establish a block formatting context is crucial, because otherwise, the containing box will not contain floated children.
  - **Example:** Without forming a BFC, you might end up with the contents of a float that end up being taller than the content beside it.
  - **Source:**
- [x] What are the various clearing techniques and which is appropriate for what context?
  - **Explanation:**
      - Empty `div` method
      - Clearfix method
      - `overflow: auto` or `overflow: hidden` method
  - **Use:** `.clearfix` is likely the most efficient method to use on a general basis due to its short construction time and lack of clipping issues compared to the overflow methods.
  - **Example:**
      - `<div style=”clear:both;”></div>`
      - `.cleafix:after {
		content: ‘ ‘;
		visibility: hidden;
		display: block;
		height: 0;
		clear: both;
		}`
      - Overflow: Parent will establish a new BFC and expand to contain its floated children.
  - **Source:**
- [x] Explain CSS sprites, and how you would implement them on a page or site.
  - **Explanation:** CSS sprites combine multiple images into one. To implement them, you would use a sprite generator and apply the proper CSS for it. Each image would have its own corresponding CSS class and background properties, which are placed in the elements which require them. 
  - **Use:** Commonly used for icons. 
  - **Source:**
- [x] How would you approach fixing browser-specific styling issues?
  - **Explanation:** By writing browser-specific CSS code, using a library like Bootstrap, and also by using a normalizer or reset CSS. My personal preference would be to use a combination normalize/reset style sheet.
  - **Use:** Safari and IE have different default fonts, which means the font on any given site can change when viewed with either browser.
  - **Source:**
- [x] How do you serve your pages for feature-constrained browsers? What techniques/processes do you use?
  - **Explanation:**
	- Graceful degradation - Building an app for modern browsers while ensuring it remains functional in older browsers.
	- Progressive enhancement - Building an app for a base level of user experience, but adding functional enhancements when a browser supports it.
	- @support tag in CSS to test whether certain features are supported.
  - **Source:**
- [x] What are the different ways to visually hide content (and make it available only for screen readers)?
  - **Explanation:**
	- Make width and height both 0 for the content.
	- Position outside the screen.
	- Indent the text by -9999px.
  - **Source:**
- [x] Have you ever used a grid system, and if so, what do you prefer?
  - **Explanation:** I have used floats and flex. I prefer flex because it feels more modernized and customizable, and has substantial browser support. I have been slightly exposed to CSS Grid Layout, but am still learning how to properly implement its `grid` property.
  - **Source:**
- [x] Have you used or implemented media queries or mobile specific layouts/CSS?
  - **Explanation:** Yes. It was to adjust the content displayed based on the user’s screen size.
  - **Use:** Re-organizing certain `<div>` and `<section>` elements on a site to be more aesthetic and functional if the user switches from a desktop to a mobile device.
  - **Source:**
- [x] Are you familiar with styling SVG?
  - **Explanation:** Yes. It has advantages over other image formats such as JPG and GIF, such as:
	- Able to be created and edited with any text editor.
	- SVG images are scalable.
	- SVG graphics do not lose quality upon being resized or zoomed.
  - **Source:**
- [x] Can you give an example of an `@media` property other than screen?
  - **Explanation:** There are 4  types of @media properties:
	- All - for all media type devices
	- Print - for printers
	- Speech - for screen-readers that “read” the page out loud.
	- Screen - for computer screens, tablets, phones, etc
  - **Example:**
	```
	@media print { 
	     body { 
		color: black
	     }
	}
	```
  - **Source:**
- [x] What are some of the "gotchas" for writing efficient CSS?
  - **Explanation:** Avoid key selectors that are tag and universal selectors. Since they match a large number of elements, browsers become overworked as they have to determine if the parents are a match. Also, avoid writing styles that change the layout. Be aware of the CSS properties which trigger reflow, repaint and compositing. Everything should have a single class.
  - **Source:**
- [x] What are the advantages/disadvantages of using CSS preprocessors?
  - **Explanation:**
	- Pros:
		- CSS is made more maintainable.
		- Easy to write nested selectors.
		- Mixins to generate repeated CSS.
	- Cons:
		- Requires tools for preprocessing.
		- Re-compilation time can be slow.

  - **Example:** Sass, Post-CSS, Less
  - **Source:**
- [x] Describe what you like and dislike about the CSS preprocessors you have used.
  - **Explanation:**
	- Likes:
		- Being able to split files and nest selectors is very efficient.
	- Dislikes:
		- Sass requires frequent re-compilation when switching between node versions.
		- Less uses variable names prefixed with @, which can be confused with native CSS keywords such as @media, @import, etc.
  - **Source:**
- [x] How would you implement a web design comp that uses non-standard fonts?
  - **Explanation:** Use `@font-face` and define `font-family`.
  - **Source:**
- [x] Explain how a browser determines what elements match a CSS selector.
  - **Explanation:** Browsers match selectors from right to left. They filter out elements in the DOM based on the key selector and go up its parent element to find matches
  - **Example:** `p span` locates all `<span>` elements and works its way up until it finds a `<p>` element. 
  - **Source:**
- [x] Describe pseudo-elements and discuss what they are used for.
  - **Explanation:** A keyword added to a selector that lets you style a specific part of the element.
  - **Example:** `span: first-line` | `button: hover` 
  - **Source:**
- [x] Explain your understanding of the box model and how you would tell the browser, through CSS, to render your layout in different box models.
  - **Explanation:** Everything inside a web-page is a box. There are several components that comprise a box model, such as padding, border, and margin. The size of an overall element is directly affected by the box element.
  - **Use:** The standard box model calculates box size by taking a specified height and width, then adding the padding and border. To change to the alternative box model, however, you would set `box-sizing: border box`, which allows you to set the box size with height and width.
  - **Example:** Content box (default), border box, etc
  - **Source:**
- [x] What does `* { box-sizing: border-box; }` do? What are its advantages?
  - **Explanation:** It changes how the height and width of elements are calculated, compared to content-box. Changes the parameters of border and padding to not affect the overall sizing of the element.
  - **Source:**
- [x] What is the CSS `display` property and can you give a few examples of its use?
  - **Explanation:** CSS display defines whether an element is treated as a block or inline element, as well as the layout used for its children, such as flow layout, grid, or flex.
  - **Example:**
	- Block - takes up the whole line in the block’s direction.
	- Inline - elements can be laid out beside one another.
	- Inline-block - allows you to place block elements side by side.
  - **Source:**
- [x] What's the difference between `inline` and `inline-block`?
  - **Explanation:** Inline-block allows you to set a width and height on the element, unlike inline alone. Inline-block also allows you to set margin and padding on all sides, whereas for inline, you can only set margin and padding on the left and right sides.
  - **Source:**
- [x] What's the difference between a `relative`, `fixed`, `absolute` and `static` positioned element?
  - **Explanation:**
	- Relative - The element’s position is adjusted relative to itself without changing layout, and allows the use of Z-index on said element.
	- Fixed - The element is removed from the flow of the page and set at a specific position, and doesn’t move when the page is scrolled.
	- Absolute - The element is removed from the flow of the page and positioned based off of the top of the DOM content. It is not affected by other elements, and can be placed exactly where you want on the DOM.
	- Static - Default position; element flows into the page as it normally would.
  - **Source:**
- [x] What existing CSS frameworks have you used locally, or in production? How would you change/improve them?
  - **Explanation:** Bootstrap and Tailwind. I like them as they are.
  - **Source:**
- [x] Have you played around with the new CSS Flexbox or Grid specs?
  - **Explanation:** Yes, to Flexbox. I find it far more efficient than using floats because of enhanced customization and sizing options.

- [x] Can you explain the difference between coding a web site to be responsive versus using a mobile-first strategy?
  - **Explanation:** 
	- A responsive website will respond by adapting its size and/or other functionalities based on the user’s screen size.
	- Mobile-first websites will cater their design to mobile devices first, and then add responsive rules for other screen sizes afterwards.
  - **Example:**
```css
.my-class {
  font-size: 12px;
}

@media (min-width: 600px) {
  .my-class {
    font-size: 24px;
  }
}
```

- [x] How is responsive design different from adaptive design?
  - **Explanation:**
	- Responsive design - A fluid website that can look good on any device. ie. A ball growing or shrinking to fit through several different hoops.
	- Adaptive design - Detects the type of device used and delivers a pre-set layout for that device. ie. Several different balls to use depending on the hoop size.

- [x] Have you ever worked with retina graphics? If so, when and what techniques did you use?
  - **Explanation:** Retina is just a marketing term to refer to high resolution screens with a pixel ratio bigger than 1. In order to have crisp, good-looking graphics that make the best of retina displays we need to use high resolution images whenever possible. However using highest resolution images will have an impact on page load times.
  - **Use:** To overcome this problem, we can use responsive images, as specified in HTML5 with the `srcset` attribute.
  - **Example:**
  ```html
  <img
    src="/images/test-1600.jpg"
    srcset="/images/test-400.jpg 400w, /images/test-800.jpg 800w, /images/test-1200.jpg 1200w"
  />
  ```

- [x] Is there any reason you'd want to use `translate()` instead of `absolute` positioning, or vice-versa? And why?
  - **Explanation:** `translate()` is more efficient than absolute positioning because it uses GPU, rather than CPU, which results in shorter paint times for smoother animations.

### Javascript

- [x] Explain event delegation
  - **Explanation:** Event delegation is the practice of adding event listeners to a parent element instead of its descendents. The listener will be affected by triggered events on the descendent elements due to the parent-child relationship.
  - **Use:** When you want some code to run when the user interacts with any one of a large number of child elements.
  - **Example:**
```html
<div id="container">
  <div class="tile"></div>
</div>
<script>
  container.addEventListener('click', (event) => (event.target.style.backgroundColor = bgChange()));
</script>
```
  - **Source:**
- [x] Explain how `this` works in JavaScript
  - **Explanation:** this references an object. When inside of a constructor function or class it will reference the object on instantiation.
  - **Use:** It is used to assign properties and values to an object on instantiation.
  - **Example:**
```javascript
class MyThing {
  constructor(passThisIn) {
    this.passThisIn = passThisIn;
  }
}
```
  - **Source:**
- [x] Explain how prototypal inheritance works
  - **Explanation:** When a property is accessed on an object, but said property does not exist within said object, it moves up the chain to see if its parent objects contain said property so it can call upon them.
  - **Use:** It can help reduce redundant code.
  - **Example:**
```javascript
function Parent() {
  this.name = 'Parent';
}
Parent.prototype.greet = function () {
  console.log('Hello from ' + Parent.name);
};
const child = Object.create(Parent.prototype);
child.cry = function () {
  console.log('waaaaaahhhh!');
};
child.cry();
// waaaaaahhhh!
child.greet();
// hello from Parent
console.log(child.constructor);
// ƒ Parent() {
// this.name = 'Parent';
// }
console.log(child.constructor.name);
// 'Parent'
```

- [x] What do you think of AMD vs CommonJS?
  - **Explanation:** Historically CommonJS was used in the back-end and runs synchronous and AMD was used in the front-end and runs asynchronous.
  - **Use:** CJS has been used in node.js for a while.
  - **Source:**
- [x] Explain why the following doesn't work as an IIFE: `function foo(){ }();`. What needs to be changed to properly make it an IIFE?
  - **Explanation:** The parser reads it as two seperate statements. First the function declaration `function foo(){ }` and then a blank function call attempt `();` The best way to fix this would be to add another set of parenthesis wrapping the function declaration `(function foo(){ })()` This changes it from a function declaration to a function expression.
  - **Source:**
- [x] What's the difference between a variable that is: `null`, `undefined` or undeclared? How would you go about checking for any of these states?
  - **Explanation:**
    - `null`: the value is intentionally absent (points to nothing in memory).
    - `undefined`: not yet assigned a value or not yet declared.
    - `undeclared`: improperly declared without let/const/var
  - **Use:** null can be used to assign the primitive value of null to a variable. undeclared throws an error where as null and undefined can be checked with a conditional
  - **Example:** `null` and `undefined` can be checked using strict equality `===`. Undeclared will throw it's own error so you could use `try...catch`
  - **Source:**
- [x] What is a closure, and how/why would you use one?
  - **Explanation:** Closure allows you to use an outer function’s scope (go into a parent, grandparent function, etc.) from within an inner function. In JavaScript a closure is created every time a function is created.
  - **Use:** It allows you to combine data with the function that will operate on that data. It is similar to OOP.
  - **Example:**
```javascript
function init() {
  var name = 'Mozilla'; // name is a local variable created by init
  function displayName() {
    // displayName() is the inner function, a closure
    alert(name); // use variable declared in the parent function
  }
  displayName();
}
init();
```

- [x] Can you describe the main difference between a `.forEach()` loop and a `.map()` loop and why you would pick one versus the other?
  - **Explanation:** `.forEach()` executes a callback function on each element, but does not return a value. `.map()` executes a callback function on each element and "maps" the result to a new array. The new array is returned.
  - **Use:** If you need the result and don't want to mutate the original array, use map. If you only need to iterate over the array then forEach can be used.
  - **Example:**
    `.forEach()`:

```javascript
const a = [1, 2, 3];
const doubled = a.forEach((num, index) => {
  // Do something with num and/or index.
});
// doubled = undefined
```

`.map()`:

```javascript
const a = [1, 2, 3];
const doubled = a.map((num) => {
  return num * 2;
});
// doubled = [2, 4, 6]
```
- [x] What's a typical use case for anonymous functions?
  - **Explanation:** They can be used in IIFEs to contain some code within a local scope so that its variables do not leak to the global scope.
  - **Use:** Essentially when you don't need a named function and the function is bound to some other action.
  - **Source:**
- [x] How do you organize your code? (module pattern, classical inheritance?)
  - **Explanation:** Single directional data flow, similar to the one used in React.
  - **Source:**
- [x] What's the difference between host objects and native objects?
  - **Explanation:** 
	- Native objects are ones that are part of the JavaScript language, such as string, math, object, function, etc.
	- Host objects are provided by the runtime environment (browser) such as window, XMLHTTPRequest, etc.
  - **Example:** Some native objects are `String`, `Math`, `RegExp`, and `Object`. A couple of host objects are `window` and `console`
  - **Source:**
- [ ] What is the difference between: `function Person(){}`, `var person = Person()`, and `var person = new Person()`?
  - **Explanation & Use:**
    - `function Person(){}` is likely being used as a constructor.
    - `var person = new Person()`is instantiated a new Person object as person.
    - `var person = Person()` is not correct and would likely return undefined. To create a new instance you would need to use the `new` operator as above.
  - **Example:**

```javascript
function Person(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

var person = Person('John');
console.log(person); // undefined
console.log(person.name); // Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'name' of undefined

var person = new Person('John');
console.log(person); // Person { name: "John" }
console.log(person.name); // "john"
```
  - **Source:**
- [x] What's the difference between `.call()` and `.apply()`?
  - **Explanation:** They are both used to invoke functions, but the difference is in how they take arguments. `.call()` takes them as comma-separated values and `.apply()` takes them as an array.
  - **Source:**
- [x] Explain `Function.prototype.bind`.
  - **Explanation:** Creates a new function with a `this` keyword that sets itself to a value provided by the function call.
  - **Use:** It binds the value of [this] in methods of classes you want to pass into other functions. Frequently performed with React components.
  - **Source:**
- [x] When would you use `document.write()`?
  - **Explanation:** It is considered dangerous, and its use is not encouraged. It can clear the entire document and replace its content with a given parameter value.
  - **Source:**
- [x] What's the difference between feature detection, feature inference, and using the UA string?
  - **Explanation:**
    - **Feature Detection:** Working out whether a browser supports a certain block of code, and running different code depending on whether it does, so that the browser can provide a working experience rather crashing/erroring in some browsers.
    - **Feature Inference:** Checks for a feature just like feature detection, but uses another function because it assumes it will also exist. Feature Detection is the better approach.
    - **UA String:** A browser-reported string that allows the network protocol peers to identify various properties of the system. It's tricky to parse and can be spoofed so it's best to avoid this method.
  - **Example:** Using feature detection:

```javascript
if ('geolocation' in navigator) {
  // Can use navigator.geolocation
} else {
  // Handle lack of feature
}
```

- [ ] Explain Ajax in as much detail as possible.
  - **Explanation:** Ajax (asynchronous JavaScript and XML) is a set of web development techniques using many web technologies on the client side to create asynchronous web applications. With Ajax, web applications can send data to and retrieve from a server asynchronously (in the background) without interfering with the display and behavior of the existing page.
  - **Use:** By decoupling the data interchange layer from the presentation layer, Ajax allows for web pages, and by extension web applications, to change content dynamically without the need to reload the entire page. In practice, modern implementations commonly use JSON instead of XML, due to the advantages of JSON being native to JavaScript.
  - **Example:** The `fetch` API is typically used nowadays for asynchronous communication.
  - **Source:**
- [ ] What are the advantages and disadvantages of using Ajax?
  - **Explanation:**
  - **Advantages:**
	    - Better interactivity. New content from the server can be changed dynamically without the need to reload the entire page.
	    - Reduce connections to the server since scripts and stylesheets only have to be requested once.
	    - State can be maintained on a page. JavaScript variables and DOM state will persist because the main container page was not reloaded.
	  - **Disadvantages:**
	    - Dynamic webpages are harder to bookmark.
	    - Does not work if JavaScript has been disabled in the browser.
	    - Some webcrawlers do not execute JavaScript and would not see content that has been loaded by JavaScript.
	    - JavaScript will have to be parsed and executed on the browser, and low-end mobile devices might struggle with this.

## Questions to ask your interviewer

1. How does Bob’s Burgers measure the success of their engineers?
2. What challenges can an engineer come across while working at Bob’s Burgers?
3. Can you explain "thing you read on their engineering blog" and how it affects Bob’s Burgers Engineers?
4. What traits are hard to find in an engineer that Bob’s Burgers would like to have?
5. How is critique given to engineers at Bob’s Burgers?
6. Do you have any questions or concerns about my qualifications?
7. If Bob's Burgers hired me today how would you know in a year's time that I was the right fit?

Here is a helpful list of other reverse interview questions: [https://github.com/viraptor/reverse-interview](https://github.com/viraptor/reverse-interview)

## Whiteboard

When talking through a whiteboard problem or a coding challenge with an interviewer you should use the PREP method. (Don't write PREP in the actual interview, but use it now while doing codewars/leetcode). Going through this will help you engage with the interviewer (and possibly burn up some time 😉)

- **Parameters**
  - Inputs
  - Ask questions
    - Will it always be a number?
    - Will it ever be negative?
    - Any gotchas?
- **Returns**
  - Ask questions
    - Do you want it returned or is a console.log better?
    - Should I pass a whole array of solutions back or just a single solution?
- **Examples**
  - Show a couple black box examples, aka test cases
    - I pass in these arguments and get these results, is that correct?
  - Examples are a good idea because "you have the receipts" if the interviewer decides to change things.
- **Pseudocode**
  - Write pseudocode of each of the steps
