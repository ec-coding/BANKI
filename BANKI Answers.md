## Behavioral

Most of the behavioral questions should be answered in the CAR format. At least three sentences for each question (one for cause, one for action and one for result). When answering begin with "At my last opportunity..." or "At my last company". Don't sell yourself out and say "bootcamp" or "school".

### CAR

- **Cause**
  - Why did you need to take action?
- **Action**
  - Steps you took so solve problem
  - Be positive
  - Don't be humble
- **Result**
  - How are you better?

### Questions

- [x] B1) Give me an example of a project or initiative that you started on your own. What prompted you to get started?

  - **Cause:** Shortly after I had left my first teaching position, I wound up wanting to spend some of my free time outside of work towards helping students from underprivileged families.
  - **Action:** Thus, I began a non-for-profit tutoring service for underprivileged grade school students, using connections I had made from my job in teaching, and also from the church I was attending at the time. I offered educational assistance in areas they were struggling in, namely for Math and Language Arts.
  - **Result:** The program lasted about 4 months, and was a tremendous success. We had amazing turnouts every week, and I myself ended up learning some valuable life lessons that I still carry with me to this day.

- [x] B2) Tell me about a time you had to work on several projects at once. How did you handle this?

  - **Cause:** During my freelancing period, I was contracted to work on multiple websites at once for different clients.
  - **Action:** I handled the workload by designating certain days and time slots for different clients, so that I would not have to divert my focus back and forth between them. In essence, they were all promised specific days where I would reach out to them with updates.
  - **Result:** The result was that I was able to tend to each client’s needs in a timely and organized fashion, which allowed me to complete each project according to their specifications. 

- [x] B3) Describe a situation in which you felt you had not communicated well enough. What did you do? How did you handle it?

  - **Cause:** At the start of a major portfolio review during my days in ocean freight shipping, I discovered that critical roles were not delegated to the proper individuals at the time of the project’s conception. 
  - **Action:** After convening with my teammates and coming to a consensus, we agreed to allocate separate responsibilities to each individual to ensure a smooth trajectory for the project. 
  - **Result:** The result was that we were able to greatly reduce the amount of role overlap brought about by the initial lack of communication, and work morale ended up improving tremendously. The portfolio was thus completed successfully and in a timely fashion.

- [x] B4) Tell me about when you had to deal with conflict within your team. How was the conflict solved? How did you handle that? How would you deal with it now?

  - **Cause:**  During my previous occupation in ocean freight shipping, I once volunteered to lead a project that would audit the company’s invoices for a specific client. The client was claiming that our company owed them a sizable sum of money due to unreported reserves.
  - **Action:** Some of my team members debated the merit of working on the project due to the lack of bonus or overtime offered. Many of them were disappointed that I had chosen to accept it, as they felt I should have negotiated for compensation beforehand.
  - **Result:** I reassured them that it was not their responsibility, and that they were not expected to contribute if they did not want to. I took on the project alone initially, but my work ethic gradually inspired my team members to volunteer their assistance over time, and we ended up completing it as a joint project together.

- [x] B5) Give me an example of a time you had to take a creative and unusual approach to solve coding problem. How did this idea come to your mind? Why do you think it was unusual?

  - **Cause:** I once had an issue deploying a project on Heroku, due to constant errors stemming from my back-end code.
  - **Action:** Because my server-side code was all contained in one file, I searched for possible ways to divide it up so that I could quarantine specific sectors to narrow down the problem area. I felt it was a very unorthodox approach at the time, as I had never thought to split my code in such fashion.
  - **Result:** In the process, I came across the concept of MVC architecture and learned how its use made it possible to mitigate the exact troubleshoots I was suffering from. I ended up adopting this architecture into all my future projects going forward.

- [x] B6) Describe a situation in which you worked diligently on a project and it did not produce the desired results. Why didn't you get the desired results? What did you learn from the experience?

  - **Cause:** My first experience with coding was to try and build a personal website to kickstart my portfolio.
  - **Action:** I attempted to create a sophisticated layout with animations and scroll-based events using only a limited knowledge of HTML and CSS, and no insight on JavaScript.
  - **Result:** I did not produce the desired results because the lack of JavaScript made it impossible for the site to trigger user events and display the appropriate content. This experience taught me the importance of each of the three front-end languages, and from then onwards, I was motivated to learn how they function altogether.

- [x] B7) Give an example of an important project goal you reached and how you achieved it.

  - **Cause:** I was once tasked with training new hires at a previous workplace, which dealt with ocean freight shipping. However, due to the outdated software that said company used, it was very difficult to relate its functions to modern-day applications.
  - **Action:** I took the initiative to document the software’s capabilities using OneNote, and included many examples on how the trainees could better understand the tasks it was developed for.
  - **Result:** The new hires were successfully trained and became integrated into my team. Furthermore, the documentation I created for the company ended up becoming the de facto training manual for future hires and internal transfers.

- [x] B8) Describe a situation in which you experienced difficulty in getting others to accept your ideas? What was your approach? How did this work? Were you able to successfully persuade someone to see things your way?

  - **Cause:** At one of my previous workplaces, we were once tasked with learning new software for taking client calls. 
  - **Action:** Because the onboarding sessions were long and scarce in breaks, I suggested to management if our team could utilize the pomodoro technique, which basically entails 25 minutes of dedicated focus, followed by a 5-minute break, all with the aim of reducing burnout.  
  - **Result:** The idea was rejected at the time, because the supervisor in charge of the course was intent on following a set schedule. However, after the workshop had ended, I approached some of my superiors and explained the merits of pomodo in a polite and civil manner. We ended up having a great discussion about employee learning expectations, and they promised to look into implementing such techniques for future onboarding sessions.

- [x] B9) Tell me about a situation when you were responsible for project planning. Did everything go according to your plan? If not, then why and what kind of counteractions did you have to take?

  - **Cause:**  At a previous job I held for a factoring company, I was placed in charge of a project that was meant to minimize the company’s financial loss due to over-aged invoices. Many of our clients were notorious for submitting shoddy paperwork that would often be rejected by their brokering companies, which led to us not receiving payment.
  - **Action:** To achieve the goals of this project, I proposed a plan to penalize repeat-offending clients with delayed purchasing dates for each time they had paperwork rejected for their truckloads. 
  - **Result:** The plan was a huge success, and as it incentivized a great number of our clients to begin submitting proper paperwork, which then eliminated a large fraction of the over-aged and unpaid invoices our division had been suffering from.
  - 
- [x] B10) Tell me about a situation when you made a mistake at work. What happened exactly and how did you deal with it? What steps did you take to improve the situation?

  - **Cause:** I once mistakenly authorized the release of a fraudulent load at my previous shipping company, which cost them a sizable amount of money when the client refused to pay for the load post-release.
  - **Action:** Afterwards, I approached my superiors and claimed responsibility for the error. I explained to them how my inexperience with detecting counterfeit invoices led me to making the mistake I did, and I promised I would be much more careful in the future if they would be willing to give me another chance.
  - **Result:** My acting manager at the time reassured me that disciplinary action was unnecessary, because seeing me own my mistake and realizing the severity of it would ensure I never repeated it in the future. I took her message to heart and the extra steps I took going forward to scan for fraudulent loads prevented me from repeating the same mistake throughout my time with the company.

- [x] B11) Tell me about a time when you worked with someone who was not completing his or her share of the work. How did you handle the situation? Did you discuss your concern with your coworker? With your manager? If yes, how did your coworker respond to your concern? What was your manager's response?

  - **Cause:** During my days in ocean freight shipping, my team had recently acquired a new member who had completed his internship with the company. However, because he had been initially trained for a different department, he had great difficulty transitioning into our responsibilities, and often missed his invoicing quotas for the day.
  - **Action:** However, because his intentions to learn and excel at his responsibilities seemed genuine, I chose not to report this case to upper management, and instead opted to assist this team member directly. During downtime, or after I had clocked out for the day, I took the effort to tutor him on his new role and how he could further assist the team by improving his skill-set.
  - **Result:** As a result, this individual became highly adept with his work responsibilities and no longer fell short of the team’s expectations. The time I had committed towards helping him had definitely borne great fruit, and we ended up working closely together for the rest of my duration with the company.

- [x] B12) Describe a situation when you worked effectively under pressure. How did you feel when working under pressure? What was going on, and how did you get through it?

  - **Cause:** At my previous workplace, I often had to work under pressure at the end of each month, due to the large influx of client invoices that arrived around said time.
  - **Action:** Repeated exposure to working under these hectic conditions allowed me to develop efficient time management skills so that I could divide and conquer my tasks with sufficient breakpoints in between.
  - **Result:** Each experience built upon the previous to the point where I felt little to no anxiety while working under high pressure conditions. I feel I have become a far more tempered worker as a result.

- [x] B13) Tell me about yourself.

  - I am a highly motivated candidate with an aptitude for productivity and process streamlining. I enjoy both the client-side and server-side immensely, and am excited that this opportunity would allow me to grow in both aspects. I really enjoy the idea that I’ll be able to see the results of my work and its connection to improving research. I think having exposure to this connection will motivate me in the long term because it aligns with my need to constantly improve my process efficiency skills.

- [x] B14) Tell me about your experience at 100Devs.

  - 100Devs is a software development agency with a training program. I worked on several projects both alone and with teammates to better refine my technical skills. The main tech stack we used were React, Node, Express, and MongoDB.

  - **Action:** 
  - **Result:** 

- [x] B19) Tell me a time when you failed.

  - **Cause:** During the start of my freelancing period, I was overly ambitious and advertised website builds I was not completely experienced with developing at the time. 
  - **Action:** As a result, I ended up disappointing my very first client by agreeing with all their demands and over-promising on features I was unable to deliver.
  - **Result:** The entire process taught me the value of learning when to say “No” and to always be honest about my limitations with the people I work with. As I moved forward from this experience, I have stood by the principle of under-promising and over-delivering when possible.

- [x] B20) What do you read on a regular basis?
  - Recently I've been reading various books on Data Structures & Algorithms along with books about different styles of coding architecture.
  - I'll also typically read movie screenplays, self-help books, and cooking guides. I'm a huge fan of our public library system and regularly use it.
